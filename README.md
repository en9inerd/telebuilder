# TeleBuilder

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/telebuilder.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/telebuilder)

TeleBuilder is a simple telegram bot framework for building telegram bots in Typescript/Javascript. It's built on top of [GramJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/telegram).


**Note:** It's still in early development and I use it for my own bots. So, let me know if you find any bugs or have any suggestions.
